What?
-----

The Redis book is an attempt at creating the definitive tutorial and reference guide to [Redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis/), an open-source, 
memory based, persistent, key-value data storage system built by Salvatore Sanfilippo of VMware. {body_class}

This repository contains a [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/) project that builds an HTML version of the book, based
upon content in HTML files found in the `content/` directory. The book's source HTML files are nanoc-style [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
documents that also contain special book-specific directives that I'm currently calling "Pebo" syntax. [ASCIIDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/)
is being considered as a long-term solution, however.

Key ambitions for the book are to be transparent (public GitHub repo with latest content), open (non-commercial Creative Commons license and allowing changes via GitHub forks),
and to make for good reading and learning (including SVG figures - some interactive, hopefully). I will be 
selling an attractive PDF and print book later on down the line while having the same content available online for free, rather
like Michael Hartl's [RailsTutorial.org.](http://railstutorial.org/)

The project has only just been started after a little offline planning. The only thing worth looking at so far is the <%= link_to 'Formatting demonstration page', 'ch1-introduction/' %>! *August 6, 2010*
