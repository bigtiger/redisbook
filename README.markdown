The Redis Book (as yet otherwise unnamed)
=========================================

What?
-----

The Redis book is an attempt at creating the definitive tutorial and reference guide to [Redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis/), an open-source, 
memory based, persistent, key-value data storage system built by Salvatore Sanfilippo of VMware.

This repository contains a [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/) project that builds an HTML version of the book, based
upon content in HTML files found in the `content/` directory. The book's source HTML files are nanoc-style [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
documents that also contain special book-specific directives that I'm currently calling "Pebo" syntax. [ASCIIDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/)
is being considered as a long-term solution, however.

The project has only just been started after a little offline planning. There is nothing to see yet. *August 6, 2010*
